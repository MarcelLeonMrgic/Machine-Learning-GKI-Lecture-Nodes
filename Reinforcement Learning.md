In reinforcement learning, an agent learns by interacting with an environment and changing itself in proportion to the rewards or penalties it receives from its actions. A key challenge is the trade of between Exploitation and Exploration

### Exploitation
Using actions that have produced high rewards in the past.

### Exploration
Trying new or less-certain actions to discover potentially better strategies.
