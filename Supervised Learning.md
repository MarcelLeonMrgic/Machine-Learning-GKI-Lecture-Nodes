A neural network is trained using labeled data, and during training it updates its internal weights in proportion to how wrong its predictions are. After the training phase comes the testing phase where the networks performance is measured with new data. In Supervised Learning we can differentiate between Regression and Classification Networks
### Regression

In an Regression Modell the network has an input vector of multiple aspects of data and only one output. F. e. The input could be financial data of a person (x1 is the income, x2 is the capital) and the output could be a probability of the person to pay back a loan.

Classification

In In **classification**, the neural network also receives an input vector, but the output is a **vector of class probabilities**. The input vector could be a picture of a cat and the output vector could be the propability the neural network calculated  of verious animals that could be on this picture (cat, dog , mouse)
